# portfolio


# The approach was to make the portfolio with HTML, CSS and Javascript
# All of the hide/show was done through jquery, along with the color changes
#
# Unsure why but having hover effects with jquery was having odd interactions on the class and chnging css randomy between active and inactive classes
#
# The page was made in one HTML file showing and hiding elements on the nav bar
# Font awesome was the only technology used to get the smaller images used as social media links
